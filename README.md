# 🖥️ Local Process & System Monitor

A **fully self-hosted process and system monitoring solution** that allows you to monitor **multiple devices and processes in real time** — without cloud dependencies, subscriptions, or device limits.

Everything runs **locally**, giving you full control over performance, privacy, and data.

---

## 🚀 About the Project

This project is designed to be a **lightweight yet powerful monitoring system** for keeping track of system resources and running processes across **many devices** from a single local dashboard.

Unlike many existing monitoring tools, this system is:
- Fully local
- Unlimited in scale
- Privacy-first
- Built to grow over time

Whether you’re monitoring one machine or an entire local network, this project aims to stay fast, simple, and flexible.
